### Adressing mode

The addressing modes available on the MC6809 and MC6809E are: Inherent, Immediate, Extended, Direct, Indexed (with various offsets and autoincrementing/decrementing), and Branch Relative. 

Some of these addressing modes require an additional byte after the opcode to provide additional addressing interpretation. This byte is called a postbyte
